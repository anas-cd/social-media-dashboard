## Overview
this is my very first project using Vue.js, it's a social media dashboard that shows all the stats of client's social media accounts 
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript framework
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) -  JavaScript library





### Continued development

I'm looking forward to learn more about the following points : 

- How to delay the (v-for) of vue so it can have some time between each instance
- How to change a style for an element outside of the mounted element of Vue, for example the "body" tag without missing with the DOM
